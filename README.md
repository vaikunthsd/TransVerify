# TransVerify
Created a Decentralized Application (DApp) using the Blockchain-based Smart Contracts to allow the secure and instantaneous verification of academic transcripts, empowering both Students and Employers.

## Getting Started with the Application

First, access the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download Node.js and then install it on your machine.

Next, we need to install Truffle, an Ethereum development environment.

```sh
npm install -g truffle

```
Clone TransVerify Application 

```sh
https://github.com/vaikunthsd/TransVerify.git
cd trans-verify
truffle develop
migrate --reset
```
#### `migrate --reset` should run inside the `truffle console`

Install npn dependencies

```sh
cd app 
npm install
```

Now Start the Server within the app directory

```sh
npm start
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser (Ideally, this url should automatically open in your default browser)

Finally, please follow the instructions provided on the Home page and then on subsequent pages.
